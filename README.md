## About Me

Hey there, nice to meet you!

I'm Kevin, a recent grad from Fullstack Academy's Software Engineering Program.
I'm enthusiastic about learning new technologies, solving real-world problems, and helping people around me.

Why I'm interested in a career in software engineering:

I want to be a software developer because I would love to utilize my problem-solving skills to develop meaningful applications that solve real-world problems. Software and apps have always been a significant part of my world since I was a kid; from video games to automation, software is all around us. My past work experience as a software engineer intern further confirmed that I'm choosing the right path toward software development as I've seen firsthand how powerful software can be and the unlimited potential of becoming a software developer.
